### Foundations year
I will be completeing the foundations year at Holberton School in Tulsa at the beginning of November 2020. During this time, I have learned bash scripting, C language, Python, HTML/CSS, Flask, MySQL, Javascript, and DevOPs practices. In my second year I will be specializing in Web Development to continue building on the knowledge I have gained and learn new frameworks.
