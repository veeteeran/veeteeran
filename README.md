### About me
I'm a software engineer at [Column](https://www.column.us/). We are a group of passionate people who are making public information systems more valuable and doing work that matters. In September 2021, I graduated from Holberton School (Tulsa) while working at [Station8](https://station8branding.com/) as an intern/junior web developer where we created beautifully designed web sites to help our clients tell their story and their why. Working with amazing people who are supportive of and accountable to each other like my previous team at [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/who-we-are/) are one of the things that drive me. I usually spend my time away from screens climbing on rocks or plastic. :climbing: Some weekends my nose is buried in a book and I've been known to talk sportball on occassion.
