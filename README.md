### Holberton School and beyond
I completed the foundations year at Holberton School in Tulsa at the beginning of November 2020. During this time, I learned how to use git on the command line, bash scripting, programming in C language, Python, HTML/CSS, Flask, MySQL, Javascript, setting up LAMP stacks, and other DevOps practices. In my second year, I will be specializing in Web Development to continue building on the knowledge I have gained. Recently I volunteered for Djangofest with Techlahoma as a coach and hope to continue helping with Techlahoma events and learning more about Django. I have also started looking into the Jamstack and learning a more about React.
